# Anycode Text Editor - Multi-functional Project Management Tool

## Project Overview

This project is a text editor developed using Qt, integrating common text editing features and providing management capabilities for various object storage services (such as FTP, SFTP, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, Amazon S3, etc.). Users can create and manage projects through this software, enabling quick uploads of local projects to the specified servers. Additionally, the software supports checking file differences via Git and SVN, ensuring that only changed files are transmitted each time, thereby improving work efficiency.

## Key Features

### Text Editing Features
- **Basic Text Editing**: Supports common text editing operations such as copy, paste, undo, and redo.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages.
- **Find and Replace**: Supports text search and replace functionality.
- **Multi-Tab Editing**: Supports multi-tab editing for handling multiple files simultaneously.

### Object Storage Management
- **FTP/SFTP**: Supports file upload, download, and management via FTP and SFTP protocols.
- **Alibaba Cloud OSS**: Integrates Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service, supporting file upload, download, and management.
- **Tencent Cloud COS**: Integrates Tencent Cloud Object Storage Service, supporting file upload, download, and management.
- **Amazon S3**: Integrates Amazon S3 Object Storage Service, supporting file upload, download, and management.

### Project Management
- **Project Creation and Management**: Users can create and manage projects to organize local and remote files.
- **Quick Upload**: Supports quick upload of local projects to specified object storage services.
- **Difference Checking**: Checks file differences via Git or SVN to ensure only changed files are transmitted.

## Windows Build

Clone the project to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/fengzhu2007/anycode.git
git submodule update --init
```

Development Environment: Qt 5.15.2  
Visual Studio 2019 or later, C++17  

Open the VS Command Tool (x64) as an administrator.

### Compile "zlib", "apr", "libexpat/expat", "apr-util", "libssh2", "libgit2"
Requires installation of CMake and Python 3.10 or later.
```
cd 3party
python build_all.py
```

### Compile OpenSSL
Requires installation of Perl (ActiveState Perl or Strawberry Perl: https://strawberryperl.com/).
```
build_openssl_x64.bat
```

### Compile curl (Choose version 7.88; versions 8.x and above require updates to higher versions of dependencies such as zlib, OpenSSL, and libssh)
```
python build_curl.py
```

### Compile Subversion
```
build_subversion_x64.bat
```

Open the project in Qt Creator (root directory `CMakeLists.txt` file).  
Since the project is managed using CMake, you need to add the CMake and Ninja from the Qt framework to the PATH environment variable. It is recommended to remove other versions of CMake from PATH (Strawberry Perl also installs CMake).  
Ninja must be the one provided by Qt; otherwise, issues may arise. If not added to the environment variable, CMake may generate VS project files for compilation, which can cause problems.  
After building with Qt Creator, copy the Qt dependency libraries and plugin libraries (`iconengines`, `imageformats`, `platforms`, `sqldrivers`) to the `anycode.exe` directory. Also, copy the dynamically linked libraries generated by third-party compilation (`3party\bin\x64\bin`) to the same directory.
